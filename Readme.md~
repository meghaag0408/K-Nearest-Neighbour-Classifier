Implementation
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The code given is used to implement K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm:
	In pattern recognition, the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. 
	In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. 
	The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression. 
	It is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning.
	The training examples are vectors in a multidimensional feature space, each with a class label.
	The training phase of the algorithm consists only of storing the feature vectors and class labels of the training samples.
	In the classification phase, k is a user-defined constant.
	The unlabeled vector (test sample) is classified by assigning the label which is most frequent among the k training samples nearest to 	that query point.
	The distance between the unlabeled test samples and all the points in the training sample are calculated by Euclidean distance.

Instructions to use the code
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-> The code is run using python filename.py without giving any command line arguments.
-> The window prompts with the data:

	Enter the source dataset filename: iris.data
	Enter the index of the class in the given dataset: 4
	Enter the value of k: 1
	Enter 1...........Random Sub Sampling
	Enter 2...........Five Fold Cross Validation
	Enter Choice
	1

-> The dataset filenames are assumed to be :
	iris.data
	wine.data
	wisconsin.data

-> If the data set will be wisconsin.data -> the missing value will be considered, so the filename should be as above mentioned.
-> The second field to be taken as input is index of the class :
 		* The attribute which is class, its index is passed an input. For instance, the class index in the above 3 databases are
			-> iris.data(4)
			-> wine.data(0)
			-> wisconsin.data(10)

-> The third value is the value of k - either 1 or 3
-> Then we need to select the algorithm type to be followed i.e either Random Sub Sampling or Five Fold Cross Validation.
-> Run the code again if the both the algorithms are needed or to be tested on some other data set.

Libraries/Packages Needed
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
These are all the packages that are required so as to the run the code:
	import random
	from matplotlib.pyplot import *
	import csv
	import math
	import operator
	from tabulate import tabulate

Make sure, they are installed prior.
